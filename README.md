# MSAI-VetDisease-CRNN-2026
Veterinary Disease Detection using CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) An AI project focused on identifying pet skin diseases (Healthy, Fungal, Bacterial, and Allergic) using a custom-built CRNN architecture. Developed for the MSAI program (Fall 2025) and aligned with SDG 3 to improve animal healthcare through automated diagnostics.

# 🐾 Veterinary Disease Detection via Custom CRNN
**Domain:** Veterinary | **Algorithm:** CRNN | **Goal:** >75% Accuracy

## 📌 Phase 1: Planning & Documentation (Completed)
This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of a CRNN for veterinary diagnostics. 

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- Classify 4 skin disease categories.
- Zero use of pre-trained models.
- Achieve 75%+ accuracy with reproducible seeding.
- Address UN SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being.

### 📁 Initial Structure
- `Documentation/`: Project Initial Doc & Timeline.
- `Data/`: Placeholder for Drive-mounted dataset.
- `Scripts/`: Training and Model architecture.
"Data Acquisition: Downloaded and organized Veterinary skin disease dataset into 4 classes."
